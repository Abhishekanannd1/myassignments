    "Strings:- strings are sequence of characters ,it is created by enclosing quotes, single quotation or double quotation can be used. Strings can be sliced ,modified and formatted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:-Variables are named location that register some space in memory to store data that is assigned to it. variables are declared using “=” ,name of the variable is in left side and its value in the right side of “equal to” sign. \n",

    "Since python is a dynamically typed language it is not necessary to declare the type of data each time, python detects types of variable by examining their value. Three different data types can be:- \n",
    "\n",
    "a)\tIntegers: These are whole numbers without any fractional part, declared as “int”. \n",
    " \n",
    "Eg.-x=3,y=-45\n",

    "b)\tFloats:-It represents real numbers, all positive and negative numbers with a decimal point can be referred as float data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eg.-x=4.33,y=-3.20 \n",

    "Ans-4 \n",
    "\n",
    "Expression is made up of values, variables and operators that evaluates a desired result, An expression is made up of values (numbers, strings, Booleans, or None) variables, and operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are a fundamental part of python programming, they allow us to perform calculations, make decisions, and control loops. Expressions can be used in a variety of ways in python. They can be used to assign values to variables, to pass arguments to functions, and to make decisions in conditional statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of expression \n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions: Used to perform mathematical operations, Eg.: X=4+8, \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison expressions: Used to compare Boolean values, result as True or false.Eg.:(3==4)\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans-5 \n",
    "\n",
    "spam=10, This is a statement which assigns the value 10 in the variable spam. A statement tells the interpreter to do something but an expression evaluates to a single value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between an expression and a statement is that an expression evaluates to a value, while a statement does not necessarily evaluate to a value, For example , \n",
    "\n",
    "The expression 4+2 valuates to a value 6, while the statement print(“India is our country”) does not evaluate to a single value. Expression are used to perform calculation while statement used to control  the flow of execution. \n"
