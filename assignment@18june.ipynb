    "    Logging in Python is a mechanism that allows developers to record and store information about the execution of a program. It provides a way to capture and save messages, warnings, errors, and other relevant information during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Logging is important in software development for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Debugging and troubleshooting: Logging helps in identifying and resolving issues in a program. By logging relevant information, developers can track the flow of execution, identify the sequence of events leading to an error, and gain insights into the program's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Monitoring and auditing: Logging enables monitoring the performance and health of an application in production. By logging key metrics, such as request/response times, resource utilization, and system events, developers can analyze and optimize the application's performance. Logs also serve as an audit trail for security and compliance purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Error and exception tracking: Logging provides a centralized record of errors and exceptions that occur during program execution. Developers can log stack traces, error messages, and contextual information to diagnose and fix issues. These logs can be used for post-mortem analysis and improving the reliability of the software.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "     The main differences between logging and print statements in Python are that logging allows for more flexibility in directing output to different destinations, such as log files; provides granular control with different log levels for filtering messages; offers built-in log formatting and structure; allows for dynamic configuration at runtime; promotes maintainable and clean code by separating debugging output; and is optimized for performance and large volumes of log messages.\n",
    "      On the other hand, print statements simply write output to the console and are typically used for temporary debugging or quick information display during development. Logging is recommended in real-world applications for its debugging capabilities, flexibility, configurability, maintainability, and performance optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Consider a web application deployed on a production server that serves multiple users concurrently. In this scenario, using logging instead of print statements offers several advantages:\n",
    "       Using logging over print statements in a real-world application allows for effective debugging, separation of concerns, log level filtering, log analysis, and flexibility in log configuration. It helps in maintaining a robust and scalable application while providing valuable insights into its behavior in production environments.\n"
